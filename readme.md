git strategy:
  each collaborator has two+ branches.
    - local master
    - local working (possibly multiple)
  all work is done in local working branches
  to merge:
    1. remote is pulled into local master branch
    2. local master is merged into local working copy
      - fix any merge conflicts here
    3. local working copy is merged into master
      - should not have merge conflicts
    4. local master is pushed up to remote
      - definitely should not have merge conflicts
