git strategy:
  <ul>
    <li>each collaborator has two+ branches.</li>
    <ul>
      <li> local master</li>
      <li> local working (possibly multiple)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>all work is done in local working branches</li>
  </ul>
    to merge:
    <ol>
      <li>remote is pulled into local master branch</li>
      <li>local master is merged into local working copy<br>
      - fix any merge conflicts here</li>
      <li>local working copy is merged into master<br>
      - should not have merge conflicts</li>
      <li>local master is pushed up to remote<br>
      - definitely should not have merge conflicts</li>
    </ol>
