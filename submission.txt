Note on testing:
Algorithms were tested extensively with random inserts and removes. The included main inserts and removes n numbers between 2n and 0 from both the
BST and RBTree. If it detects an error - the tree has misaligned pointers, or for RBTrees, the black height is off, or a red node has a red parent,
it prints the tree and then exits. This should allow easy error detection for large N. It does not check for valid binary search tree structure,
however, due to using search to locate nodes to delete, an improperly formed BST would quickly become evident. It also does not check for a red 
root node, however we checked a number of cases manually for this beharvior. Inserting to an empty tree, and removing the last node is also tested
to work.
